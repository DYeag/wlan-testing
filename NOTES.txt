Notes for TIP WiFi testing related topics.


# To pull the latest upstream lanforge-scripts repo into the wlan-lanforge-scripts
# repository, use this or similar command.  This action will probably only be done
# by whoever is curating the wlan-lanforge-scripts repository.

git pull git@github.com:greearb/lanforge-scripts.git


# Testbed setup

Test-Controller system must be able to ssh into the LANforge system w/out a password
(use authorized_keys ssh setup) as both user lanforge and user root.

Test-Controller will need to be able to access the Cloud-SDK machines.  Not sure
exact details on this yet.

For each new test-bed hardware config (including LANforge and AP hardware types and radio
layouts), a new directory in testbeds/ should be created, and populated with test-bed specific
LANforge scenario and test configuration files.  See 'ben-home' for examples.
See lanforge/lanforge-scripts/gui/README.txt for details on ways to grab the appropriate text,
but you will also need familiarity with LANforge to accomplish this easily.
