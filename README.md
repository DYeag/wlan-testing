## TIP Open WiFi Testing
This repository contains the test automation framework and scripts for TIP Open WiFi.
Test Framework is implemented in pytest

## Test Cases are Classified as follows
```bash

│   ├── controller_tests  -/* Library Support for controller_tests part  */
    ├── apnos   -/* Library Support for Access Points (uses AP SSH)  */
│   ├── lanforge    
│   ├── perfecto    -/* Library Support for Perfecto Traffic Generator*/
│   ├── testrails   -/* Result Visualization (will be depreciated )*/

    |── README.md  - /* Pytest framework and testcases information */
```
##Follow the below instructions to setup the Testing and Development Environment

```bash
STEP 1

git clone https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-testing
git clone https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-lanforge-scripts

Make sure this directory structure exists
├── wlan-lanforge-scripts
├── wlan-testing


cd wlan-testing

./sync_repos.bash

STEP 2

Make sure you have python version >= 3.8
User this to check "python --version"

Lets Install the Python Packages needed

pip3 install pytest==6.2.2
pip3 install bs4
pip3 install paramiko
pip3 install xlsxwriter


STEP 3 

Lets Install Controller Libraries, follow below steps:

mkdir ~/.pip
echo "[global]" > ~/.pip/pip.conf
echo "index-url = https://pypi.org/simple" >> ~/.pip/pip.conf
echo "extra-index-url = https://tip-read:tip-read@tip.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/pypi/tip-wlan-python-pypi-local/simple" >> ~/.pip/pip.conf
echo "tip-wlan-cloud" > ~/.pip/requirements.txt
pip3 install -r ~/.pip/requirements.txt

STEP 4

Setup configuration.py file
This file is autogenerated by Quali-Lab-Orchestration
You can custom create the configuration file, by following the sample configuration data structure (tests/configuration.py)

STEP 5

You are all set,

To verify that everything is working,

cd wlan-testing/tests
pytest -m test_connection -s -vvv


Now, follow tests/README.md to understand the Testing Framework, and How to run and 
write new tests

=======
1. number == NOLA testbed number this cloud controller is assigned to
2. version == docker images version to use with this particular deployment. supports 3 options:
  1. "%arbitrary_text%" - will use `%arbitrary_text%` images
  2. "" - will use `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-yyyy-mm-dd` images from yesterdays date
 
## Motivation
Automate Automate and Automate!
>>>>>>> master

## Build status
*WIP*  
[![Build Status](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-testing/workflows/nightly%20build/badge.svg)]

## Best Practice
1. Ensure to have a python version > 3.8
2. We strongly recommend to use virtualenv to ensure that your dev environment sandbox is created.

## Code style
All code must be written in python 3 and conform to PEP 8 style guide. The test framework is built using pytest.
